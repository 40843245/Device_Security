In this article, I will tell you: 
Some basic concepts of password and 
simple and basic ways to prevent your password is guessed and hijacked as possible?
(Although there are NO way that your password is NEVER guessed or hijacked, 
there is some way that it takes a very long time to guess or hijack your password)

----------------------------
Rule:
It is important, please pay a lot of attention.
(1.1)DON'T use LAZY password.
Lazy password refers password which is easy to guessed by people.
These are examples for lazy passwords. 
1234
123456
abcdefg

The above examples are easy to guess for you, aren't they?

(1.2)DON'T use too SHORT password.
Set it as LONG as possible.

It takes a short time to hijack a short password if one use brute-force
(i.e. try all possibles. It is analogous to a person who try all keys to open the door, so it is called.)
(such as one runs the program with a high performance device).

(1.3)DON'T tell anyone your password.
If you tell anyone your password, one doesn't have to guess since one has already known.

(1.4)DON'T record your password anywhere (especially on the paper which is nearby of your device).
If you record your password, one may not have to guess since one has already known.
