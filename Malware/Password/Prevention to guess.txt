In this article, I will tell you: 
Some basic concepts of password and 
simple and basic ways to prevent your password is guessed and hijacked as possible?
(Although there are NO way that your password is NEVER guessed or hijacked, 
there is some way that it takes a very long time to guess or hijack your password)

----------------------------
Rule:
It is important, please pay a lot of attention.

I think the (1.1) to (1.6) is the more than others, I recommend you to implement these rules in your daily life, 
or your password may be hijacked or guessed.

(1.1)DON'T use LAZY password.
Lazy password refers password which is easy to guessed by people.
These are examples for lazy passwords. 
1234
123456
abcdefg

The above examples are easy to guess for you, aren't they?

(1.2)DON'T use too SHORT password.
Set it as LONG as possible.

It takes a short time to hijack a short password if one use brute-force algorithm
(i.e. try all possibles. It is analogous to a person who try all keys to open the door, so it is called.)
(such as one runs the program with a high performance device).

(1.3)DON'T tell anyone your password.
If you tell anyone your password, one doesn't have to guess since one has already known.

(1.4)DON'T record your password anywhere (especially on the paper which is nearby of your device).
If you record your password, one may not have to guess since one has already known.

(1.5)DON'T use same password in different websites.

(1.6)DON'T set your password about you and which is commonly used in your daily life.
The information about you is easily known by your friends, your family, or even online friends, isn't it?

If you think the password is hard too remember, I recommend you to mixed your informations and some random numbers (or alternatively the information which is NOT easily available and guess (such as your dog's nickname which was, in and will be seldom told to anyone))as your password, or
you can insert one or many chars into your information.
Such as
A person whose birthday is 2022/12/26. 
He's 80 age old.
He lives in England.

NOT RECOMMEND PASSWORD, WEAK PASSWORD:
20221226
England
ENGLAND
80
2022122680
8020221226
ENGLAND80
ENGLAND20221226

ACCEPTED PASSWORD FOR ME:
ENG1LA6ND
ENGLAND444
2022ENG12LAND26

The above examples are NOT easily guessed, aren't they?

(1.7)DON'T allow the website to store your password.
You can consider these issues.
What happens if the website is hijacked by a hijacker?
What happens if the website devloper steals your password?

(1.8)DON'T NEVER change password.
A password must be hijacked if one uses brute-force algorithm (which I discussed above).
Even if it a strong password. 
A strong password will be hijacked or guessed for a very long time if one uses brute-force algorithm. 
And a weak password will be hijiacked or guessed for a short time if one uses brute-force algorithm.

(1.9)Pay attention to the website.
Does it stores your really password (Here the really password is password you entered before login in successfully)?
If it really stores your really password, you must be aware. 
And I recommend you that you DON'T use this website if you can.
Why?
What happens if the website devloper steals your really password? 
(In this case, the website devloper must know because your really password is stored in database.)
