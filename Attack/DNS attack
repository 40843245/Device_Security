In this article, I will talk about DNS attack.
-----------------------------------
Introduction to DNS attack:
DNS attack refers the attack to DNS.

-----------------------------------
Type:
(2.1)DNS Tunneling:
It usually features data payloads that can take over a DNS server and allow attackers to manage the remote server and applications. 
(2.2)DNS Amplification:
DNS amplification attacks perform DDoS on a targeted server. 
This involves exploiting open DNS servers that are publicly available, in order to overwhelm a target with DNS response traffic. 
(2.3)DNS Flood Attack:
One deploys valid (but spoofed) DNS request packets at an extremely high packet rate and then create a massive group of source IP addresses.
Since the requests look valid, 
the DNS servers of the target start responding to all requests.
After a while, the DNS server can become overwhelmed by the massive amount of requests. 

Valid (but spoofeed) DNS request packaet
=> create a massive group of IP address 
=> the DNS server responses the massive group of IP address
=> the DNS servers goes down and can NOT server more request at this moment.
