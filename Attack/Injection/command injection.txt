In this article, I will discuss:
What is command Injection?
-----------------------------------------------------
Introduction to Command Injection:
Command Injection refers the technique that enters some texts in text entry field to run the specific command.

Some poeple may think that it is NOT possible!!!

It is possible!!!
It is possible!!!
It is possible!!!

In Linux, each semicolon ";" refers the end of a statement.
If one types texts with semicolons more than 1 time and submit, then these statements will be performed. 
Hence, one can perform lots of commands just by entering some texts with semicolons more than 1 time in Linux.

For example, 
one submits texts with 
https://example1.com;pwd;
in text entry field.
Then one can look at current location of directory in Linux.

P.S.
pwd command in Linux refers look at current location.

It is dangerous.
In above example, one can look at current location in Linux. Then visit all sensitive data, trying to access it which can cause may attacks.

Prevention:
I recommend you to follow all methods.
[method 1]
Take a view at input text.
(2.1)Check input is valid or invalid by regular expression.

[method 2]
Take a view at input text.
(2.2)Set the length of input field.
Such as 
An input field to fecth one's birthday does NOT need more than 10 chars.
Thus, you can set the maximum length of input field as 10.

[method 3]
Take a view at access privilege.
(2.3)Minimize privilege as possible if it is NOT needed.

[method 4]
(2.4)DON'T display the error message about database and system as possible. 
If it is needed, display more fuzzy error message as you can.
