In this article, I will talk about SQL injection.

----------------------------------------
SQL injection refers insert one or many chars in SQL cmd to 
(1.1)Fecth some data.
(1.2)Modified some data.
(1.3)Make the system etc crash.
etc

----------------------------------------
SQL injection can be categorized into 3 major thypes.
(2.1)In-band SQL Injection:
(2.1.1)Union-based:
(2.1.1.1)Insert an UNION cmd in SQL cmd to merge all records for display into 1 record to fetch specific data.
(2.1.1.2)Insert an '||' (logical OR)symbol in SQL cmd to select all records or all fields to fetch specific data.
logical OR refers one of these statements are true, the result must be true.
Such as the following statement.
a OR b

When either a or b (or both) is true, 
a OR b
is true.

Image that if one inserts "|| 1==1" at the end of where statement.

For example,
the original cmd is

SELECT field1,field2 where cond1=='test' and cond2=='true';

Cmd after modified

SELECT field1,field2 where (cond1=='test' and cond2=='true') or (1==1);

The SQL cmd after modified must display all records since the where statement is always true.

(2.1.2)Error-based:
Insert one char or more chars in SQL cmd to cause error when running SQL cmd,
fetching specific data from error message.

(2.2)Inference (Blind) SQL Injection:
(2.2.1)Content-based
According to message displayed in GUI.
(2.2.2)Time-based
According to time we wait for.

(2.3)Out-of-band SQL Injection:
Through SQL injection to attack system that associate with SQL server. 
Such as DNS server.
