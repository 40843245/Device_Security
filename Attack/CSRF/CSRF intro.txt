In this article, I will tell you:
What is CSRF attack?

-------------------------------------
Abbreviation:
Cross Site Request Forgery

-------------------------------------
Analogy:
Image that you are a customer in a restaurant. 
A stranger uses your table ID and then submit menu into a waiter.
And the waiter does NOT check the menu is submitted by yourself.

Thus, you have to bill for the menu which the stranger submits.

In this analogy, I ananlogize the above example with these transitions.
Stranger is similar to Attacker
Menu is similar to Request
Table ID is similar to cookie in website
Waiter is similar to Web sevrer
You is similar to User

That's the core concept of CSRF.
-------------------------------------
Introduction:
CSRF refers the technique of a forgery request between different websites.
