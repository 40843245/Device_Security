(2.4)Google Ads.
I must declare it before discussion.
Google can fast find ads with malware or even virus within only a few hours and then try to remove it.
So, we don't worry about Google's product. Just don't do anything to any ads, I believe the ads does NOT harm your device.

In 2018 year, there were a report to YT, saying when one user watched videos on YT, the antiware was activated.
Then "CoinHive" was found in these ads.
"CoinHive" can attack your device. In the attacked device, there are 80% CPU are used to mine for attackers.
