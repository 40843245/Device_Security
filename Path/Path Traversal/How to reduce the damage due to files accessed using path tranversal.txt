In this article, I will teach you:
How to reduce the damage due to file accessed using path traversal?

------------------------------------------
Introduction to traversal:
Traversal refers to visit all possibles.

------------------------------------------
Introduction to path traversal:
Path traversal refers to visit all path(i.e. files and folders) in the specific device.

How to reduce the damage due to file accessed using path traversal?

There are three different methods we can discussed.

[method 1]
Take at view at filtering out some specific chars when path traversal.
(3.1)The most intuitive way is to disallow path traversal using remote devices.
It works, but implement it is really hard.

Uhh? Some people may think that the path in Windows 10 consists of a slash, isn't it?
Such as 
C:/Users/user/Program Files/Unity.exe

The answer is correct. 
However, the encoding matters the issue.

In UTF-8 encoding,  
%c1%1c 
will be encoded to a slash
/

In Github,
a whitespace
will be encode as 
%20
(See the following link in "Introduction to privilege" section.)

The attacker may use different chars to traverse path and it may be allowed (if the chars are NOT filtered, it depends on how you develop it)
If you DON'T most ways to traverse path, this method is useless.

P.S.
I forgot to tell you that some attacker will inject the chars to avoid the limits of specific char.


[method 2]
Take a view at access privilege.
I believe that most people ever have heard the word "privilege". 
But, I want to simply introduce the word "privilege".

------------------------------------------
Introduction to privilege:
Privilege determines which type of people have the ability to access.

If you want to learn more knowledge about privilege, you can visit my note in the Github. Given in the following link.

------------------------------------------

(3.2)Minimize the access privilege as possible (especially for sensitive data).
It can reduce the damage even if the attacker successfully find the specific data by path transveral.

[method 3]
(3.3)Data handling.
Data handling is NOT more important than the method 1 and method 2. Thus, I won't discuss this method here.
